Great, so we can intercept HTTP traffic -- what's next?

Unfortunately, there's a problem. What happens if we navigate to a site with TLS enabled? For example, `https://google.com/`:\
![Screenshot showing the FireFox HSTS warning message about the Portswigger CA cert not being trusted](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/8b4b43cac91cd9a80622b953598d05eb.png)

We get an error.

Specifically, Firefox is telling us that the Portswigger **C**ertificate **A**uthority (CA) isn't authorised to secure the connection.

Fortunately, Burp offers us an easy way around this. We need to get Firefox to trust connections secured by Portswigger certs, so we will manually add the CA certificate to our list of trusted certificate authorities.

First, with the proxy activated head to ; this will download a file called `cacert.der` -- save it somewhere on your machine.

Next, type `about:preferences` into your Firefox search bar and press enter; this takes us to the FireFox settings page. Search the page for "certificates" and we find the option to "View Certificates":\

Clicking the "View Certificates" button allows us to see all of our trusted CA certificates. We can register a new certificate for Portswigger by pressing "Import" and selecting the file that we just downloaded.

In the menu that pops up, select "Trust this CA to identify websites", then click Ok:\

We should now be free to visit any TLS enabled sites that we wish!

The following video shows the full import process:\
